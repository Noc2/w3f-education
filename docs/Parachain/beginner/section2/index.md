title: Dependency Installation & Preparation
---

With a high level, preliminary understanding of how a network like Polkadot functions at the architectural level, it is now time to put together one of our own.  We will be installing and using Polkadot and Substrate binaries and dependencies to provision both the relay and parachain locally on our machine.

In this section, you will:

- Install `polkadot` and the `substrate-parachain-template`.
- Acquire the necessary configuration files for running them.
- Run both simultaneously in preparation for connecting them.
