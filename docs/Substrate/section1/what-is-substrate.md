Substrate is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components. The Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (FRAME) is a set of modules and support libraries that simplify runtime development. In Substrate, these modules are called Pallets, each hosting domain-specific logic to include in a chain's runtime.

In order to get the most out of Substrate, you should have a good knowledge of computer science and basic blockchain concepts. Terminology like header, block, client, hash, transaction and signature should be familiar. Substrate is built on the [Rust Programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which makes use of novel design patterns to enable development of code that is safe and fast. Although you don't need to know Rust to get started with Substrate, a good understanding of Rust will allow you to become a better Substrate developer.
