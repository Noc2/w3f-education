Substrate is a modular framework that enables you to create domain-specific blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components.  The *Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (**FRAME**)* is a set of modules and support libraries that simplify runtime development.  In Substrate, these modules are called **pallets**, each hosting domain-specific logic to include in a chain's runtime.

Substrate may be utilized to create a solo chain and parachain for a relay chain like Polkadot (respectively).  At its core, it is a set of Rust crates that provide the most basic primitives and protocols to implement a distributed state machine, such as a blockchain.

:::info An analogy: React, the library for web and native user interfaces

Another way to think about Substrate is similar to how a web developer may use/think about React.  Where React provides core libraries for manipulating the elements of the DOM via developer-defined components, Substrate also provides the base libraries and primitives needed to create a blockchain.  It was designed to not be opinionated via a highly generic codebase, enabling high customizability.

## Substrate's Libraries

Substrate, as mentioned, is a collection of Rust crates that define a generic way to implement a blockchain.  Although you will only use a few of these libraries directly in this course, know that everything you use is built upon them. 

You will encounter two primary prefixes when developing with Substrate crates: `sc-` and `sp-`.  Crates prefixed with `sc-` usually refer to network-related functionalities, such as peer-to-peer networking or consensus.  The `sp-` prefix usually indicates that the library in question is for allowing the outer node and runtime to communicate. 

 A few significant crates that you will encounter are: 

- [`sp_runtime`](https://crates.parity.io/sp_runtime/index.html) - Runtime modules shared primitive types
- [`sp_core`](https://crates.parity.io/sp_core/index.html) - Shareable Substrate types
- [`sp_io`](https://crates.parity.io/sp_io/index.html) - I/O host interface for substrate runtime. Substrate runtime standard library as compiled when linked with Rustâ€™s standard library.

These, along with many more, all pertain to building certain aspects of a particular distributed system.

## A Brief Introduction to FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)

A common question is: _If Substrate exists, what is FRAME for?  Why is it mentioned so often?_.

FRAME, or Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities, is another abstraction on top of Substrate.  It introduces a set of conventions and structures for building a blockchain with Substrate through numerous Rust macros.  These macros enable the powerful and trivial to use a system of **pallets** to construct **runtimes** using Substrate.  A **runtime**, also called a **state transition function (STF)**, defines the state transitions for a particular blockchain.

As we advance, terminologies such as **pallets**, and custom bundles of business logic that make up a runtime will be expected.  If a term here is unfamiliar and undefined, reference the glossary.

Remember, a state machine is the core concept of a blockchain.  FRAME facilitates the way for state to propagate and change in a more developer-friendly way.

The outcome of developing on Substrate, particularly FRAME, is almost always a **runtime** (compiled to WebAssembly, or Wasm), also called a **state transition function (STF)**.  This runtime defines the core logic that determines how state propagates and changes in a blockchain.  In the coming lessons, you will learn more about how a runtime works and eventually dive deeper into its structure.
