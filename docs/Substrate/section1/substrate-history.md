Substrate, at its origins was created very near the conception of Polkadot.  In fact, the two are usually are inseperable - where there is Substrate, there is Polkadot.

To set context - Polkadot is a relay chain, which uses Substrate libraries and FRAME.  Substrate is a blockchain developer framework.  It enables for the creation of solo chains or parachains.  Originally, much of what was Substrate came from Polkadot due to necessity.  This is due to the fact that if parachains were to be built, it would be sensible to make all common blockchain protocols and primitives available to parachain developers.
