description: Learn the history of how Substrate came about and its relevance to Polkadot.
---

Substrate, at its origins, was created very near the conception of the Polkadot network.  The two are usually inseparable - where there is Substrate, there is Polkadot.  Parachains that connect to Polkadot are also built using Substrate, generally using some abstractions such as FRAME and Cumulus.

Setting the context is crucial to understand Susbtrate's role in web3.  Polkadot is a relay chain that uses Substrate libraries and FRAME.  Substrate is a blockchain developer framework.  It enables the creation of solo chains or parachains.  Initially, much of what was Substrate came from Polkadot due to necessity.  The reasoning behind this choice was if parachains were to be built, it would be sensible to make all standard blockchain protocols and primitives available to parachain developers.
