:::info The prerequisites to learning Substrate

You should have good knowledge of computer science and basic blockchain concepts, as well as proficiency in at least one programming language.  Terminology like header, **block**, **client**, **hash**, **transaction** and **signature** should be familiar. Substrate is built on the [Rust Programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which makes use of novel design patterns to enable the development of code that is safe and fast. Programming in Rust is essential for developing on Substrate. However, you don't need to know Rust to start learning about the Substrate blockchain-building framework. Learning of Rust and Substrate can go hand in hand if you are unfamiliar with Rust programming.


If you would like to brush up or learn the basics of Rust, feel free to take our [Intro to Rust course](../../introrust.md).

:::

In this first module, you will learn what Substrate (and **FRAME**) is, the context behind its existence, and the design choices that make it a unique solution in the wider Web3 industry.  This module will set the tone for the rest of the course, where you will get hands-on experience with Substrate and FRAME.
