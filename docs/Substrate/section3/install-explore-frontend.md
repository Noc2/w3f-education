The [front end template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) is a valuable source that will allow us to quickly verify and test our Substrate chain with minimal interference.  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template.git
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install

# To start it
yarn start
```

## The Polkadot.js Explorer

The explorer is also a great way to get more insight into your nodeâ€™s operations. Go to:

[Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)

Once there, you can click the upper left, and make sure you have **Local Node** selected.
